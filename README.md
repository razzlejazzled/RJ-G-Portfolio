# Portfolio
This is a basic HTML/CSS Portfolio for myself made upon successful completion of the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. 

### Template
Design is not my strong suit, so I used a template for the layout of this site. The free template is called Devfolio and comes from [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com)

### Content
In addition to showing off six projects and/or assignments from my time in Bootcamp, the site also offers some basic biographical information and contact information.

### Deployment
The deployed site is deployed via Github pages and can be found [here](https://razzlejazzled.github.io/RJ-G-Portfolio/)
