# Portfolio
This is a basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript Portfolio for myself made upon successful completion of the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. 

### Template
Design is not my strong suit, so I used a template for the layout of this site. The free template is called Devfolio and comes from [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com)

### Content
In addition to showing off six projects and/or assignments from my time in Bootcamp, the site also offers some basic biographical information and contact information.
Highlighted projects include, but are not limited to: 
* L-Plan [Repo](https://github.com/scottdouglas238/Lesson_Planner)
* Workout Mongo [Repo](https://github.com/razzlejazzled/Workout-Mongo)
* Hops & Hounds [Repo](https://github.com/razzlejazzled/Project1)


### Deployment
The deployed site is deployed via Github pages and can be found [here](https://razzlejazzled.github.io/RJ-G-Portfolio/)
